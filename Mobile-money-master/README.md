# Zindi Mobile Money and Financial Inclusion in Tanzania challenge


The train dataset contains demographic information and what financial services are used by approximately 10,000 individuals across Tanzania. This data was extracted from the FSDT Finscope 2017 survey and prepared specifically for this challenge. More about the Finscope survey here.

Each individual is classified into four mutually exclusive categories:

- No_financial_services: Individuals who do not use mobile money, do not save, do not have credit, and do not have insurance
- Other_only: Individuals who do not use mobile money, but do use at least one of the other financial services (savings, credit, insurance)
- Mm_only: Individuals who use mobile money only
- Mm_plus: Individuals who use mobile money and also use at least one of the other financial services (savings, credit, insurance)
